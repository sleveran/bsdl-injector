--------------------------------
-- BSDL for ADSP-21060L Digital Signal Processors
-- in the PQFP (EDQUAD) and CQFP (heat slug up - CZ) packages
--
-- Created: 7/18/94
-- Modified:6/26/95   - corrected for errors not found by parser
--			syntax and opcode section
--          12/8/95   - corrected tristate case of CPA (o/d),
--                      controlled by itself
--	     4/24/96  - changed MS,PAGE from out to inout
--		      - changed attribute TAP_SCAN_RESET of TRST
--			from signal is false to true	
--	     6/4/96   - changed INSTRUCTION_OPCODE and 
--			INSTRUCTION_CAPTURE patterns from LSB-to-MSB to
--			MSB-to-LSB notation
--	     5/4/98   - changed INSTRUCTION_OPCODE and 
--			INSTRUCTION_CAPTURE patterns from MSB-to-LSB to
--			LSB-to-MSB notation (See note at INSTRUCTION_CAPTURE)
--           1/8/99   - Separated into individual files, removed obsolete BSDL
--                      Corrected VDD and GND naming
