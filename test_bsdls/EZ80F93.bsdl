--    file could be used with F92 or F93 devices. Flash and RAM sizing is
--      die wire bonding controlled.  Both F92 and F93 BSDL files are
--      provided for clarity.
--    file is the same as eZ80L92.bsd except for:
--      device name and IDCODE contents
--  
--  eZ80F93 is 1149.1 compatible not compliant.
--  This BSDL file is 1149.1 compliant.
--  eZ90F93 does not have a boundary register. Standard boundary register
--  defaults to outputting the OCIREV 8-bit code.
--
--  See eZ80 Device BSDL File Usage Applications Note.
