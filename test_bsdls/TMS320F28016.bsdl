--  
--  Initialization Requirements for Boundary Scan Test
--  --------------------------------------------------
--
--  The F280x DSPs use the JTAG port for boundary scan tests, emulation
--  capability and factory test purposes.  To use boundary scan test,
--  the following pin configuration must be used:
--
--      EMU1    = 0
--      EMU0    = 1
--      TRSTN   = 0 -> 1 ( transitioning to a 1 will latch the device into
--                         boundary scan mode )
--
--  TRSTN is a reset to the JTAG state machine (active low), hence it has
--  to be pulled high before any JTAG scans are made. 
--
--  F280x Devices have two taps - one for the CPU and one for boundary scan.
--  The boundary scan IR size is 3 bits.
--
--  Device Pins not testable by Boundary Scan
--  ------------------------------------------
--  The following pins cannot be tested through boundary scan:
--  EMU0, EMU1, XCLKIN, X1, X2, TEST1, TEST2, and all the analog pins
