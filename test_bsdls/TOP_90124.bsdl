-- *****************************************************************************
--   This BSDL file can be used to program the UCD90124 Digital Sequencer.  The
--   UCD90124 has a standard JTAG port but does not support Boundary Scan.
--   In order to program the UCD90124, JTAG must first be enabled.  This can be
--   done by running the device at I2C address 126 or by shorting the address
--   pins on the device.  Please see the device data sheet for more details.
